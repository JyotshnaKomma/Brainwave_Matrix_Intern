#  Online Store Database Management System

This project is developed as part of my Brainwave Matrix Solutions Internship. It models an **Online Store** using a relational database to manage products, customers, orders, and payments.

##  Objective
Design and implement a relational database for an online store to efficiently manage:
- Customer data
