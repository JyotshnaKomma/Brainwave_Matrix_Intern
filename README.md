#  Library Management System – SQL Project

This is a relational database project developed during my internship at **Brainwave Matrix Solutions**. The goal of the project is to design and implement a functional **Library Management System** using SQL. It replicates a real-world library environment with members, books, staff, and issue/return tracking.

##  Features Implemented

- ER diagram-based database design
- Creation of normalized relational tables with keys and constraints
- Insertion of sample data
- SQL queries using joins, filters, grouping, and aggregate functions
- View for active book issues
- Trigger to automatically calculate fines on late returns
- Update and delete operations for maintenance

---


##  Tables Overview

- `Categories` – Stores book genres or subjects
- `Books` – Stores all book-related details
- `Members` – Library users who borrow books
- `Staff` – Library staff details
- `Issues` – Borrow/return history for each book
- `Fines` – Penalty tracking for late returns

Highlights
Triggers: Automatically insert a fine when a book is returned late

Views: v_active_issues shows current unreturned books with member and book details

UPDATE/DELETE: Examples for maintaining the data

SQL Best Practices: Used constraints, normalization, and realistic data modeling
